# sass_compiler

Thanks for reading this document! 

# Overview

This is a tool to compile `.sass` (or `.scss`) to cascade stylesheet format: `css`.

The same things can be accomplished with typing `sass -w` in the original sass binary though, what I wanted to do was to replicate the function that the original application has and to practice coding in both Python and PHP language.

It may have bugs and less stability and I did not expect this to be used in a wide variety of situation, so __do not use this project for your practical use!__


# How to use

1. Simply edit `./script.py` so that it suits your needs.
2. Type this: `python ./script.py`
